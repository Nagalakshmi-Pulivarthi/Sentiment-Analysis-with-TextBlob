# Sentiment-Analysis-with-TextBlob
Description: In this mini project, we scrape posts from the Hacker News website and perform sentiment analysis on the posts, defining whether a post has a negative, neutral, or positive sentiment.

Required Libraries: pandas, requests, BeautifulSoup,textblob.

How the Project Works:
* The program scrapes the headlines of each post on the News website using requests and BeautifulSoup.(https://news.ycombinator.com/)
* The website contains the headline of each post:
* We generate sentiment analysis by using the Text Blob Python library to define the sentiment of each post headline (i.e., negative, neutral, or positive) and print out the data frame that contains the posts with the sentiment value
